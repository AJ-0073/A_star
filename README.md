A* Pathfinding Algorithm (Python)

This project implements the A* pathfinding algorithm using a grid-based map.
It reads input from input.txt, finds the shortest path from a start point to a goal point, and prints the result.

Features

Grid-based A* search

Manhattan distance heuristic

Reads grid, start, and target from input.txt

Prints shortest path and cost

Handles obstacles (cells with 1)
